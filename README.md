# react-appState-useReducer-with-context

Why can't things be simple. I think `useReducer` with `createContext` can handle app state nicely without all the overhead. Build yourself out some robust reducers to manage state and I think you are in good shape for many use cases involved with non-trivial apps.

This example app sets up the scaffolding for managing app state with `useReducer` and `createContext`.

What are your thoughts?
